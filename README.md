# Learn2Reverse
A single place to put all documentation, tools and research links my Journey to learning and understanding reverse engineering / firmware hacking. Information, tools and repo's are updated as I go, for each new tool learned it will be added to this doco and the links to install along side them. I will also be uploading any firmwares that I work on into the "Firmwares" folder in this repository

## Tools
A list of commonly used tools to help start disecting firmware

**SquashFS** - Squash FS is one of the most commonly used files systems within embedded devices, it is a read only Linux file system so it will have a very familiar look and feel to any novice linux user. In order to uncompress SuashFS directories we may need a tool, such as UnsquashFS.
